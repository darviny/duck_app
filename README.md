# Darwin the Duck ü¶Ü

**Learn by teaching Darwin the Duck - where AI becomes your student, not your tutor.**

Darwin the Duck is an AI-powered learning companion that flips the traditional AI tutoring model on its head. Instead of asking AI to teach you, you become the teacher - explaining concepts to Darwin, a curious AI student who doesn't know much about your subject. This leverages the scientifically-proven Prot√©g√© Effect, where teaching others actually helps you learn better.

## üéØ What it does

**AI-Powered Learning Through Teaching**
Darwin the Duck transforms you from a passive learner into an active teacher. Instead of receiving information from AI, you explain concepts to Darwin - a curious AI student who doesn't know much about your subject.

**Real-Time Teaching Evaluation**
Our dual-AI system continuously evaluates your teaching effectiveness. After each explanation, you receive feedback on clarity, accuracy, engagement, and suggestions for improvement.

**Gamified Learning Experience**
Darwin has emotional states, energy levels, and understanding meters that update in real-time. The 3D duck responds to your teaching quality, making learning feel personal and engaging.

**Topic-Flexible Learning**
Choose from predefined subjects or create custom topics. Whether you're learning linear algebra, programming concepts, or historical events, Darwin adapts to be your eager student.

**Evidence-Based Learning**
Leveraging the scientifically-proven Prot√©g√© Effect, the system ensures you're not just memorizing - you're truly understanding and internalizing concepts through the act of teaching.

**Personalized Study Companion**
Darwin remembers your teaching style and adapts questions to challenge your understanding at the right level, creating a personalized learning journey that grows with you.
